Or, if you're not on Linux, you can just manually run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pre-commit install
git lfs install
```

Recommended software:
- Editor: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) full IDE with advanced functionality compared to the Godot Editor, but needs to be configured properly

### Project specific Guidelines ( Programming )

- We are using a global Autoload Event/Signal Bus where all `signals` that aren't purely for intra-module communication will reside. If possible try to design your modules in away that they only communicate through those global signals with the outside.
- We are using Formatter and Linter plugins that will automatically re-format your code or point out potential Errors when you save your Scripts. This may cause some confusion and also trigger the "Newer Files on Disk" Dialog in the Godot Editor, where you can choose "Reload from Disk"
- It's against convention to use `_variable` for variables that *are not* unused. Use `p_variable` instead if you run into issues, eg. in `_init()`
- We discourage the use of `await`, `set_deferred()` and `call_deferred()` unless you know exactly what you are doing and what the implications are. Best to leave a comment above that line to inform Code Reviewers why you think it's safe to use in your case.
